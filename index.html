            <h3>Card Contents 1</h3>
            <p>I think the OC is asking how to use cards in Bootstrap 3. The answer is
              that
              Bootstrap 4 cards are called panels in
              Bootstrap 3. So the answer is to use panels, since cards and panels
              are
              pretty
              much the same thing. – Scott M. Stolz Jan
